# Credit-Risk-Management
This project focuses on building a robust Credit Risk Prediction Model designed to strike an optimal balance between minimizing credit defaults and maximizing revenue generation. Leveraging the power of XGBoost, the model predicts the Probability of Default (PD) for each applicant, enabling smarter, data-driven credit approval decisions.

🔍 Objective
The primary goal is to establish a model that enforces a 10% default rate threshold, accepting applicants with a PD below the threshold and rejecting those above it. This strategy helps financial institutions manage risk while maintaining profitability
📊 Tools & Techniques
Modeling Algorithm: XGBoost

Metric: Probability of Default (PD)

Threshold: 10% default rate for applicant acceptance
